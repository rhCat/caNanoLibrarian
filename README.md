# caNanoLibrarian
This is the backend of the caNanoLibrarian app, which is a LLM based natural language searching experience for a structure database.

We have the application on https://cananolibrarian.azurewebsites.net/login, if you want to play with it, the passcode is caNanoLibrarian_DEMO_wkrh_6152023*.
We have a limited budget for this project, please let us know if you want to continue explore it when the GPT complains about limit. Thanks.
